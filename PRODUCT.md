# Afterhours – Product Overview ☕🌙

- Sit peacefully alone with a drink or laptop
- Study or work without pressure
- Spend quality time with friends or colleagues
- Hold informal meetings or conversations
- Relax, read, or simply unwind

There is no time pressure, no forced ordering, and no loud environment.

## Digital Card System 💳
Each member receives a digital Afterhours card:
- Rechargeable based on selected plan
- Tracks remaining benefits (drinks, meals, hours)
- Works seamlessly at entry and ordering points
- Designed to feel simple, not transactional

## Coupons & Personal Benefits 🎁
The system can offer:
- Category-based coupons (students, groups, regulars)
- Surprise rewards for frequent visitors
- Event-based offers (exam weeks, rainy days, festivals)
- Group benefits for friends visiting together

All offers are designed to feel like care, not marketing.

## Technology Philosophy
Technology at Afterhours should:
- Stay in the background
- Reduce friction, not create it
- Support humans, not replace interactions
- Never make users feel like they are “using an app”

The space always comes first. Software only supports it.
