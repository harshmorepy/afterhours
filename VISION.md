# Afterhours – Vision

Afterhours is a calm, welcoming space designed for people to relax, connect,
and feel present — without pressure, noise, or forced productivity.

It is not a café.
It is not a club.
It is not a co-working space.

Afterhours exists as a “third place” where individuals and groups can spend
time meaningfully — whether alone with a laptop, with friends, or meeting
new people naturally.

The experience should feel warm, unhurried, and human-first.

Technology in Afterhours should stay in the background, quietly enhancing
the experience through digital memberships, passes, and personalized benefits,
without making users feel like they are using software.

The long-term goal is to build a community-driven space that can scale from
a local hangout into a recognizable brand across cities.
