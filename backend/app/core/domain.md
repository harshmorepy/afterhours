# VibeOS – Core Domain Concepts

## Person
A human who enters Afterhours.
They may be a student, freelancer, guest, or part of a group.
A Person does not require login at the beginning.

## Visit
A time-bound presence of a Person inside Afterhours.
Every meaningful interaction in VibeOS happens during a Visit.

## Space
A physical or logical area inside Afterhours where a Visit occurs.
Example: lounge, café, quiet zone.

## Vibe
A soft emotional or experiential state of the space.
Examples: calm, focused, social, cozy.
Vibe influences how the place feels, not how it functions.
